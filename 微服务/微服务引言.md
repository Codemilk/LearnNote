Microservices Guide
In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services,
each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.
These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.
There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages
and use different data storage technologies.

-- James Lewis and Martin Fowler (2014)


Late in 2013, hearing all the discussion in my circles about microservices, I became concerned that there was no clear definition of microservices (a fate that caused many problems for SOA).
So I got together with my colleague James Lewis, who was one of the more experienced practitioners of this style.
Together we wrote
We wrote the article to provide a firm definition for the microservices style, which we did by listing the common characteristics of microservice architectures that we saw in the field.

* Componentization via Services
* Organized around Business Capabilities
* Products not Projects
* Smart endpoints and dumb pipes
* Decentralized Governance
* Decentralized Data Management
* Infrastructure Automation
* Design for failure
* Evolutionary Design
We also looked at common questions such as "how big is a microservice" and "what's the difference between microservices and Service-Oriented Architecture".
The article catalyzed interest in microservices.

微服务导论

简而言之,微服务架构风是一种发展单个应用程序到一整套小服务的方法,它们每一个运行在自己的进程并且通过轻量级的机制通信,经常是一个HTTP资源的API.
这些服务围绕业务功能建造的,并且完全自动化机制独立部署在机械.这些服务被最小限度的管理,它们可以由不同的程序语言设计,也可以使用不同的数据存储技术.

2013下半年,听到了很多关于微服务的讨论在我的圈子，我开始担心它会有不明确的定义(SOA就因为这样出现很多问题)，所以我和我的同事jams lewis,他是最有经验的从业者之一.
我们一起写了这篇文章关于微服务风格明确的定义,我们列出了一些清单关于我们所看出关于在微服务领域中中相同的特性

* 通过服务组件化
* 围绕业务功能组织
* 是一个产品而不是一个项目
* 智能端点和傻瓜管道
* 分散管制
* 分散数据管理
* 基础设施自动化
* 容错设计
* 进化式设计
我们也发现了同一个问题,多大才是一个微服务和微服务和面向服务架构有什么不同
